# Chapter 6: Limiting Scope Exposure

## Least Exposure
Think of it this way: why shouldn't you just place all the variables of your program out in the global scope? That probably immediately feels like a bad idea, but it's worth considering why that is. When variables used by one part of the program are exposed to another part of the program, via scope, there are three main hazards that often arise:

* **Naming Collisions**: if you use a common and useful variable/function name in two different parts of the program, but the identifier comes from one shared scope (like the global scope), then name collision occurs, and it's very likely that bugs will occur as one part uses the variable/function in a way the other part doesn't expect.

    For example, imagine if all your loops used a single global `i` index variable, and then it happens that one loop in a function is running during an iteration of a loop from another function, and now the shared `i` variable gets an unexpected value.

* **Unexpected Behavior**: if you expose variables/functions whose usage is otherwise *private* to a piece of the program, it allows other developers to use them in ways you didn't intend, which can violate expected behavior and cause bugs.

    For example, if your part of the program assumes an array contains all numbers, but someone else's code accesses and modifies the array to include booleans and strings, your code may then misbehave in unexpected ways.

    Worse, exposure of *private* details invites those with mal-intent to try to work around limitations you have imposed, to do things with your part of the software that shouldn't be allowed.

* **Unintended Dependency**: if you expose variables/functions unnecessarily, it invites other developers to use and depend on those otherwise *private* pieces. While that doesn't break your program today, it creates a refactoring hazard in the future, because now you cannot as easily refactor that variable or function without potentially breaking other parts of the software that you don't control.

    For example, if your code relies on an array of numbers, and you later decide it's better to use some other data structure instead of an array, you now must take on the liability of adjusting other affected parts of the software.

POLE, as applied to variable/function scoping, essentially says, default to exposing the bare minimum necessary, keeping everything else as private as possible. Declare variables in as small and deeply nested of scopes as possible, rather than placing everything in the global (or even outer function) scope.

If you design your software accordingly, you have a much greater chance of avoiding (or at least minimizing) these three hazards.

Consider:

```js
function diff(x,y) {
    if (x > y) {
        let tmp = x;
        x = y;
        y = tmp;
    }

    return y - x;
}

diff(3,7);      // 4
diff(7,5);      // 2
```

In this `diff(..)` function, we want to ensure that `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, so that when we subtract (`y - x`), the result is `0` or larger. If `x` is initially larger (the result would be negative!), we swap `x` and `y` using a `tmp` variable, to keep the result positive.

In this simple example, it doesn't seem to matter whether `tmp` is inside the `if` block or whether it belongs at the function levelâ€”it certainly shouldn't be a global variable! However, following the POLE principle, `tmp` should be as hidden in scope as possible. So we block scope `tmp` (using `let`) to the `if` block.

## Where To `let`?

My advice to reserve `var` for (mostly) only a top-level function scope means that most other declarations should use `let`. But you may still be wondering how to decide where each declaration in your program belongs?

The way to decide is to ask, "What is the most minimal scope exposure that's sufficient for this variable?"

Once that is answered, you'll know if a variable belongs in a block scope or the function scope. If you decide initially that a variable should be block-scoped, and later realize it needs to be elevated to be function-scoped, then that dictates a change not only in the location of that variable's declaration, but also the declarator keyword used. The decision-making process really should proceed like that.

If a declaration belongs in a block scope, use `let`. If it belongs in the function scope, use `var`.

This usage pattern is not terribly uncommon, but most feel it smells like poor code structure. A preferable approach is to use another outer-scoped variable for that purpose:

```js
var lastI;

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    lastI = i;
    if (checkValue(i)) {
        break;
    }
}

if (lastI < 5) {
    console.log("The loop stopped early!");
}
```

`lastI` is needed across this whole scope, so it's declared with `var`. `i` is only needed in (each) loop iteration, so it's declared with `let`.

## Function Declarations in Blocks (FiB)

My real concern with FiB is, what advice can I give to ensure your code behaves predictably in all circumstances?

As far as I'm concerned, the only practical answer to avoiding the vagaries of FiB is to simply avoid FiB entirely. In other words, never place a `function` declaration directly inside any block. Always place `function` declarations anywhere in the top-level scope of a function (or in the global scope).
