# Chapter 2: Illustrating Lexical Scope

## Lookup Failures

When *Engine* exhausts all *lexically available* scopes (moving outward) and still cannot resolve the lookup of an identifier, an error condition then exists. However, depending on the mode of the program (strict-mode or not) and the role of the variable (i.e., *target* vs. *source*; see Chapter 1), this error condition will be handled differently.

#### Undefined Mess

If the variable is a *source*, an unresolved identifier lookup is considered an undeclared (unknown, missing) variable, which always results in a `ReferenceError` being thrown. Also, if the variable is a *target*, and the code at that moment is running in strict-mode, the variable is considered undeclared and similarly throws a `ReferenceError`.

The error message for an undeclared variable condition, in most JS environments, will look like, "Reference Error: XYZ is not defined." The phrase "not defined" seems almost identical to the word "undefined," as far as the English language goes. But these two are very different in JS, and this error message unfortunately creates a persistent confusion.

"Not defined" really means "not declared"â€”or, rather, "undeclared," as in a variable that has no matching formal declaration in any *lexically available* scope. By contrast, "undefined" really means a variable was found (declared), but the variable otherwise has no other value in it at the moment, so it defaults to the `undefined` value.

To perpetuate the confusion even further, JS's `typeof` operator returns the string `"undefined"` for variable references in either state:

```js
var studentName;
typeof studentName;     // "undefined"

typeof doesntExist;     // "undefined"
```

These two variable references are in very different conditions, but JS sure does muddy the waters. The terminology mess is confusing and terribly unfortunate. Unfortunately, JS developers just have to pay close attention to not mix up *which kind* of "undefined" they're dealing with!

#### Global... What!?

If the variable is a *target* and strict-mode is not in effect, a confusing and surprising legacy behavior kicks in. The troublesome outcome is that the global scope's *Scope Manager* will just create an **accidental global variable** to fulfill that target assignment!

Consider:

```js
function getStudentName() {
    // assignment to an undeclared variable :(
    nextStudent = "Suzy";
}

getStudentName();

console.log(nextStudent);
// "Suzy" -- oops, an accidental-global variable!
```

Here's how that *conversation* will proceed:

> ***Engine***: Hey, *Scope Manager* (for the function), I have a *target* reference for `nextStudent`, ever heard of it?

> ***(Function) Scope Manager***: Nope, never heard of it. Try the next outer scope.

> ***Engine***: Hey, *Scope Manager* (for the global scope), I have a *target* reference for `nextStudent`, ever heard of it?

> ***(Global) Scope Manager***: Nope, but since we're in non-strict-mode, I helped you out and just created a global variable for you, here it is!

Yuck.

This sort of accident (almost certain to lead to bugs eventually) is a great example of the beneficial protections offered by strict-mode, and why it's such a bad idea *not* to be using strict-mode. In strict-mode, the ***Global Scope Manager*** would instead have responded:

> ***(Global) Scope Manager***: Nope, never heard of it. Sorry, I've got to throw a `ReferenceError`.

Assigning to a never-declared variable *is* an error, so it's right that we would receive a `ReferenceError` here.

Never rely on accidental global variables. Always use strict-mode, and always formally declare your variables. You'll then get a helpful `ReferenceError` if you ever mistakenly try to assign to a not-declared variable.

### Building On Metaphors

To visualize nested scope resolution, I prefer yet another metaphor, an office building.

The building represents our program's nested scope collection. The first floor of the building represents the currently executing scope. The top level of the building is the global scope.

You resolve a *target* or *source* variable reference by first looking on the current floor, and if you don't find it, taking the elevator to the next floor (i.e., an outer scope), looking there, then the next, and so on. Once you get to the top floor (the global scope), you either find what you're looking for, or you don't. But you have to stop regardless.

## Continue the Conversation

By this point, you should be developing richer mental models for what scope is and how the JS engine determines and uses it from your code.
