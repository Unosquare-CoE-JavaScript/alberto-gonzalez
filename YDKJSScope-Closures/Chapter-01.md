# Chapter 1: What's the Scope?

Our focus will be the first of three pillars in the JS language: the scope system and its function closures, as well as the power of the module design pattern.

JS is typically classified as an interpreted scripting language, so it's assumed by most that JS programs are processed in a single, top-down pass. But JS is in fact parsed/compiled in a separate phase before execution begins.

JS functions are themselves first-class values; they can be assigned and passed around just like numbers or strings. But since these functions hold and access variables, they maintain their original scope no matter where in the program the functions are eventually executed. This is called closure.

## Compiled vs. Interpreted

You may have heard of *code compilation* before, but perhaps it seems like a mysterious black box where source code slides in one end and executable programs pop out the other.

Interpretation performs a similar task to compilation, in that it transforms your program into machine-understandable instructions. But the processing model is different. Unlike a program being compiled all at once, with interpretation the source code is transformed line by line; each line or statement is executed before immediately proceeding to processing the next line of the source code.


## Compiling Code

Scope is primarily determined during compilation, so understanding how compilation and execution relate is key in mastering scope.

## Required: Two Phases

To state it as simply as possible, the most important observation we can make about processing of JS programs is that it occurs in (at least) two phases: parsing/compilation first, then execution.

## Syntax Errors from the Start

Consider this program:

```js
var greeting = "Hello";

console.log(greeting);

greeting = ."Hi";
// SyntaxError: unexpected token .
```

The only way the JS engine could know about the syntax error on the third line, before executing the first and second lines, is by the JS engine first parsing the entire program before any of it is executed.

## Early Errors

Next, consider:

```js
console.log("Howdy");

saySomething("Hello","Hi");
// Uncaught SyntaxError: Duplicate parameter name not
// allowed in this context

function saySomething(greeting,greeting) {
    "use strict";
    console.log(greeting);
}
```

How does the JS engine know that the `greeting` parameter has been duplicated? How does it know that the `saySomething(..)` function is even in strict-mode while processing the parameter list (the `"use strict"` pragma appears only later, in the function body)?

Again, the only reasonable explanation is that the code must first be *fully* parsed before any execution occurs.

## Hoisting

Finally, consider:

```js
function saySomething() {
    var greeting = "Hello";
    {
        greeting = "Howdy";  // error comes from here
        let greeting = "Hi";
        console.log(greeting);
    }
}

saySomething();
// ReferenceError: Cannot access 'greeting' before
// initialization
```

The noted `ReferenceError` occurs from the line with the statement `greeting = "Howdy"`. What's happening is that the `greeting` variable for that statement belongs to the declaration on the next line, `let greeting = "Hi"`, rather than to the previous `var greeting = "Hello"` statement.

The only way the JS engine could know, at the line where the error is thrown, that the *next statement* would declare a block-scoped variable of the same name (`greeting`) is if the JS engine had already processed this code in an earlier pass, and already set up all the scopes and their variable associations. This processing of scopes and declarations can only accurately be accomplished by parsing the program before execution.

The `ReferenceError` here technically comes from `greeting = "Howdy"` accessing the `greeting` variable **too early**, a conflict referred to as the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

## Targets

What makes a variable a *target*? Consider:

```js
students = [ // ..
```

## Cheating: Runtime Scope Modifications

It should be clear by now that scope is determined as the program is compiled, and should not generally be affected by runtime conditions. However, in non-strict-mode, there are technically still two ways to cheat this rule, modifying a program's scopes during runtime.

Neither of these techniques *should* be usedâ€”they're both dangerous and confusing, and you should be using strict-mode (where they're disallowed) anyway. But it's important to be aware of them in case you run across them in some programs.
