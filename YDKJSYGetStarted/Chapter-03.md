# Chapter 3: Digging to the Roots of JS
### Consuming Iterators

With the ES6 iteration protocol in place, it's workable to consume a data source one value at a time, checking after each `next()` call for `done` to be `true` to stop the iteration. But this approach is rather manual, so ES6 also included several mechanisms (syntax and APIs) for standardized consumption of these iterators.

One such mechanism is the `for..of` loop:

```js
// given an iterator of some data source:
var it = /* .. */;

// loop over its results one at a time
for (let val of it) {
    console.log(`Iterator value: ${ val }`);
}
// Iterator value: ..
// Iterator value: ..
// ..
```

## Iterables

The iterator-consumption protocol is technically defined for consuming *iterables*; an iterable is a value that can be iterated over.

The protocol automatically creates an iterator instance from an iterable, and consumes *just that iterator instance* to its completion. This means a single iterable could be consumed more than once; each time, a new iterator instance would be created and used.

We can also iterate the characters in a string one at a time:

```js
var greeting = "Hello world!";
var chars = [ ...greeting ];

chars;
// [ "H", "e", "l", "l", "o", " ",
//   "w", "o", "r", "l", "d", "!" ]
```

et's define closure in a pragmatic and concrete way:

> Closure is when a function remembers and continues to access variables from outside its scope, even when the function is executed in a different scope.

We see two definitional characteristics here. First, closure is part of the nature of a function. Objects don't get closures, functions do. Second, to observe a closure, you must execute a function in a different scope than where that function was originally defined.

These closures are not a snapshot of the `msg` variable's value; they are a direct link and preservation of the variable itself. That means closure can actually observe (or make!) updates to these variables over time.

```js
function counter(step = 1) {
    var count = 0;
    return function increaseCount(){
        count = count + step;
        return count;
    };
}

var incBy1 = counter(1);
var incBy3 = counter(3);

incBy1();       // 1
incBy1();       // 2

incBy3();       // 3
incBy3();       // 6
incBy3();       // 9
```

Each instance of the inner `increaseCount()` function is closed over both the `count` and `step` variables from its outer `counter(..)` function's scope.

## `this` Keyword
When a function is defined, it is *attached* to its enclosing scope via closure. Scope is the set of rules that controls how references to variables are resolved.

But functions also have another characteristic besides their scope that influences what they can access. This characteristic is best described as an *execution context*, and it's exposed to the function via its `this` keyword.

Scope is static and contains a fixed set of variables available at the moment and location you define a function, but a function's execution *context* is dynamic, entirely dependent on **how it is called** (regardless of where it is defined or even called from).

`this` is not a fixed characteristic of a function based on the function's definition, but rather a dynamic characteristic that's determined each time the function is called.

One way to think about the *execution context* is that it's a tangible object whose properties are made available to a function while it executes. Compare that to scope, which can also be thought of as an *object*; except, the *scope object* is hidden inside the JS engine, it's always the same for that function, and its *properties* take the form of identifier variables available inside the function.

```js
function classroom(teacher) {
    return function study() {
        console.log(
            `${ teacher } says to study ${ this.topic }`
        );
    };
}
var assignment = classroom("Kyle");
```

One way to think about the *execution context* is that it's a tangible object whose properties are made available to a function while it executes. Compare that to scope, which can also be thought of as an *object*; except, the *scope object* is hidden inside the JS engine, it's always the same for that function, and its *properties* take the form of identifier variables available inside the function.

```js
function classroom(teacher) {
    return function study() {
        console.log(
            `${ teacher } says to study ${ this.topic }`
        );
    };
}
var assignment = classroom("Kyle");
```

The outer `classroom(..)` function makes no reference to a `this` keyword, so it's just like any other function we've seen so far. But the inner `study()` function does reference `this`, which makes it a `this`-aware function. In other words, it's a function that is dependent on its *execution context*.

The inner `study()` function returned by `classroom("Kyle")` is assigned to a variable called `assignment`. So how can `assignment()` (aka `study()`) be called?

```js
assignment();
// Kyle says to study undefined  -- Oops :(
```

In this snippet, we call `assignment()` as a plain, normal function, without providing it any *execution context*.

Since this program is not in strict mode (see Chapter 1, "Strictly Speaking"), context-aware functions that are called **without any context specified** default the context to the global object (`window` in the browser). As there is no global variable named `topic` (and thus no such property on the global object), `this.topic` resolves to `undefined`.

Now consider:

```js
var homework = {
    topic: "JS",
    assignment: assignment
};

homework.assignment();
// Kyle says to study JS
```

A copy of the `assignment` function reference is set as a property on the `homework` object, and then it's called as `homework.assignment()`. That means the `this` for that function call will be the `homework` object. Hence, `this.topic` resolves to `"JS"`.

Lastly:

```js
var otherHomework = {
    topic: "Math"
};

assignment.call(otherHomework);
// Kyle says to study Math
```

A third way to invoke a function is with the `call(..)` method, which takes an object (`otherHomework` here) to use for setting the `this` reference for the function call. The property reference `this.topic` resolves to `"Math"`.

## Prototypes

Where `this` is a characteristic of function execution, a prototype is a characteristic of an object, and specifically resolution of a property access.

Think about a prototype as a linkage between two objects; the linkage is hidden behind the scenes, though there are ways to expose and observe it.
